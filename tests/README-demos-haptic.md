# Video demo

There are two configurations:

- [standard](dboxIXdemos.scd) - standard demo using VBAP spatializer for the
floor prototype
- [wave beahvior](dbox_dual_stereo_wave_demo.scd) - the same as bove but using
a modified spatializer for illustrating "wave effect"

Load the desired file into SuperCollider IDE and execute.
