Satie4Unity provides SuperCollider-based audio rendering support for Unity3D. A Unity3D package, containing a demo scene and all the necessary resources is provided, as well as the Unity3D scripts (already in the package) themselves. 

To run the example, create an empty scene in Unity, then import the package. Then launch supercollider and evaluate the file "satieOSCexample.scd‚Äù.  Then run the scene.
